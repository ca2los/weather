# [WEATHER DASHBOARD](https://github.com/ca2los/)
A project based on Javascript, HTML 5, CSS and free APIs to demonstrate how to obtain data and print the values 
for each array element when the program is executed. 

#### [TRY IT HERE!](https://github.com/ca2los/) *Version 1.0*

### This webtool also makes use of TWO APIs:

- [x] https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-all
- [x] https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api#current

### How does it work?
1. When the page has loaded, the MAIN tag at the HTML will be empty, but once the program loads by the click listener of the search
button, then new tags will be created. [Take a look at the HTML](https://github.com/ca2los/)
2. In the Javascript file, the first API to load information is Rest Countries API. This service retrieves additional data like the
multiple versions of the country's name. This is how the program searches the country and then retrieves information for the weather.
3. Now that we have the name, Open Weather API loads the weather conditions for the chosen country.
4. Finally, the Javascript creates the HTML tags to print the data.

### Get the weather and additional data from any country in the world
You can find a country by typing the name in any of the available languages at the program. 
**Attention:** This version of the program recognizes only names without typos. 

- [x] English
- [x] Spanish
- [x] Dutch

- [x] Japanese
- [x] French
- [x] Italian

### A forecast webtool
Any country you are interested. You only need to type the name and press Enter or click the button to obtain results. The data is
updated by minute, so everytime you search, the program shows updated info about the country's weather.

### It's more than a weather APP!
